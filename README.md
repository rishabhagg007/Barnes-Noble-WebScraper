# Barnes-Noble-WebScraper
Created a web crawler for Barnes and Noble using Jsoup Library in Java. The program will go to "B&N Top 100” section and downloads HTML pages for first 40 books. The program then reads html pages and parses them to Jsoup Object. It further access each individual book page  and access the “Overview” section of the page and print 
the first 100 characters of the overview text to screen.
